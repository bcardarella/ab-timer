# ATHLEAN-X Ab Workout Timer

Program: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jyhJ6TiUPA

This script will take you through the workout program. It uses the
Mac OS
[say](https://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/say.1.html) terminal app.
If you are not on Mac OS this probably won't work.

## Usage

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/bcardarella/ab-timer.git`
2. Change to the directory `cd ab-timer`
3. Run the script: `elixir ab-timer.exs`
